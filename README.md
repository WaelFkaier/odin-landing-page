# odin-landing-page
Basically, a continuation of me learning web development, and here we are...
building a landing page using HTML and CSS.
I think i will struggle a bit when it comes to Flexbox as i am relatively new and when it comes to my country's CS High School Curriculum, it's not implemented...
but it's fine... hopefully will finish it up nicely, trusting the process... as usual
LET'S GO!

Well, this was a pretty fun project to work, i think i could improve on the code and especially on the Flexbox section... but it's been fun and let's not be maniac for each detail for now
